# Peace + Mind

Welcome to Peace + Mind a website catered to find your peace of mind. This project hopes to give the user a tranquil, easy flow experience to find their inner peace, packed with information about the company and why the user should sign up. This website offers a free one to one session with an expert guru who will cater to the needs of the user specifically via a *'Join Us'* form. It also contains contact information (mobile, address, email) for further information. 

This site is intended for busy working people who want to take some time for themselves for some self-care to improve their focus, reduce stress or anxiety, improve quailty of sleep or general self-improvement. This site will be useful to the target audience (young working women) as it offers a range of classes and concepts they can get involved in to achieve their self-care goals. 

Peace + Mind offers a *'join us'* form to have a free session with a *"meditation guru"* where they will assign classes and tasks to suit the user and their busy schedule. 

# Features
## Navigation:

1. Featured at the top of the page, I went for a simple one page navigation bar. I choose this style as my website has a minamilst quality and I wanted the least amount of noise as possible.
2. I decided to only have two links as my website is clearly laid out and it seemed unnecessary to have more. I went with *'Contact Us'* and *'Join Us'* as they are located at the bottom of the page and so the user can nagivate to it faster if needed. 
3. The navigation is clear and concise and makes the different sections of the website easy to discover. Contact information is at the bottom of the page so I thought best to place a link for this at the top of the page. 
4. The *'Join Us'* form is at the bottom of the page so I thought a link at the top of the page would make good practise. 
5. I thought this poisitoning was best to make clearer navigation particularly - for mobile phone navigation. 
6. I placed padding around the links to give it a 'button-feel' and make it more distinctive in the header. I gave it the color white to contrast with the heavy pink pallet.  


## The Header

1. The header contains the title of my webiste and my two navigation links. 
2. I used Monteserrat font as it was recommended as a 'yoga type' font family. 
3. My inital name for the website was *'Peace of Mind.'* I decided to go with *'Peace + Mind'* as I felt it was more in line with my minialist design. Also later I can use the icon of a *'peace sign'* and *'brain'* to resemble the name of my website which I thought was good design and visually pleasing for the user.

## About Us

1. The About Us section lets the user know what *'Peace + Mind'* is all about. It lets the user know what the company offers and that their studio is open both online and in person. 
2. It clearly explains what *Peace + Mind* has to off and who should use this service. 
4. This section is very straight-foward and straight to the point- following inline with my minialist, flow design. 
5. I centered the text and gave it 150% for line spacing as I felt this made it clearer to read and was easier on the eye.

## Information side bar

1. The information side bar asks the user *'What can we help you with?'*
2. It is visually pleasing with the use of icons and pink text boxes. 
3. Another text box is placed under these asking the user key questions to entice them into joining *'Peace + Mind'*

## Our Gurus side bar

1. The Guru side bar lists the practitioners that work at *'Peace + Mind.'*
2. It lists there names and qualifications each separated by a line.
3. I used this deisgn as it is minimalist and gets straight to the point. The user can read what practitioners work there and what they then might be interested in.

## Join Us Form

1. The join us section contains a form to collect details from the user so they can sign up and claim their free session with an expert guru. 
2. The form collects the users first name, second name, and email adddress. 
3. The join us form is valuable to the user as it gives them the ability to sign up to *Peace + Mind* and claim their free session. 
4. The form is programmed to be valid so that a person has to enter a vaid email in the email box, a name in each name box and nothing else will be accepted.  
5. The submit buttom works and stores the data.

## Contact Section

1. I created a contact section that contains an email address, phone number and locaton of yoga studio. 
2. I placed this in boxes under the information bar.
3. I noticed there was obvious space on this side of the page and decided to place the comtact box there. 
4. I felt it ran in function and style with the information box. 
5. It encourages the user to get in contact and gives them the ability to find and contact Peace + Mind if they need to.

## Photo Grid

1. I implemented a photo grid to display to the user a gallery of calming images and people doing different yoga poses. 
2. I felt this was visually pleasing and encouraged the user to get involved.

## Footer

1. Social media links are placed in the footer with a clickable link. 
2. I spaced out each social media platform for a more visually pleasing site.

# Features Left to Implement

## Header

1. I would like to get rid of this navigation and implement a burger menu. I like the current navigation but I think a burger menu would look more aesthetically pleasing and allow the site to be more fluid. 

## Information Side Bar

1. I would like to make each list item clickable links to take the user to more information on each item explaining how important meditation and yoga is for sleep, stress, focus etc. 
2. I would also like these boxes to hover when the mouse is placed over them. 

## Our Gurus Side Bar

1. I would like each expert guru to have their own profile so when clicked it would take the user to their profile where they could learn more about each practitioner. 

## Color Pallet

1. In hindsight the color pallet of my site is quite feminine. As this is my target audience I did not think it would be an issue but potentially if I were to redesign the website a more gender neutral color may be a better choice. 


# Testing

1. I tested that this site works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
2. I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes.
3. I confirm my sections- navigaion, header, about us, join us, contact text are all readable and easy to understand. 
4. I confirmed that my join us form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

# Bugs

1. When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages I discovered my project was broken, the links to the other files (CSS and videos) did not work. 
2. I discovered this was because I had used absoulte file paths such as this code : (screenshot of code)
3. Removing the starting / fixed the problem. 
4. Another bug I came across was my site wasn't displaying - only the directory listing displayed. 
5. I discovered (with the help of tutor mentoring) that my index.html was nested in my assets folder and so had to be moved to the root directory for it to display properly. 

## Unfixed Bugs

- No unfixed bugs.

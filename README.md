# Peace + Mind

Welcome to Peace + Mind a website catered to find your peace of mind. This project hopes to give the user a tranquil, easy flow experience to find their inner peace, packed with information about the company and why the user should sign up. This website offers a free one to one session with an expert guru who will cater to the needs of the user specifically via a join us form. It also contains contact information (mobile, address, email) for further information. 

This site is intended for busy working people who want to take some time for themselves for some self-care to improve their focus, reduce stress or anxiety, improve quailty of sleep or general self-improvement. This site will be useful to the target audience as it offers a range of classes and concepts they can get involved in to achieve their self-care goals. 

Peace + Mind offers a 'join us' form to have a free session with a "meditation guru" where they will assign classes and tasks to suit the user and their busy schedule. 

# Features
## Navigation:

1. Featured at the top of the page, I went for a simple navigation bar. I choose this style as my website has a minamilst quality and I wanted the least amount of noise as possible.
2. I decided to only have two links as my website is clearly laid out and it seemed unnecessary to have more. I went with 'Contact Us' and 'Join Us' as they are located at the bottom of the page and so the user can nagivate to it faster if needed. 
3. The Navigation is clear and concise and makes the different sections of the website easy to discover. Contact information is at the bottom of the page so I thought best to place a link for this at the top of the page. 
4. The 'Join Us' form is at the bottom of the page so I thought link at the top of the page would make good practise. 
5. I thought this poisitoning was best to make clearer navigation particularly - for mobile phone navigation. 
6. I placed padding around the links to give it a 'button-feel' and make it more distinctive in the header. I gave it the color blue to match the hero image at the bottom of the page for some color contrast. 


## The Header

1. The header contains the title of my webiste and my two navigation links. 
2. This section also contains an "About Us" section which clearly defines what the site is and what the company has to offer. 
3. This section conatins a "sign up" section providing the user with clear information to sign up for their free session. 

# About Us

1. The About Us section asks the user key questions to entice the user in, depending on whether they answer yes or no. 
2. It clearly explains what Peace + Mind has to off and who should use this service. 
3. This section also informs the user to "join us" for their free one to one session with an expert guru who will take them on their spirtitual journey. Leaving a nice segway for the user to sign up. 
4. This section is very straight-foward and straight to the point- following inline with my minialist, flow design. 
5. I centered the text and gave it 150% for line spacing as I felt this made it clearer to read easier on the eye. 

# Sign Up Form

1. The join us section contains a form to collect detals from the user so they can sign up and claim their free session with an expert guru. 
2. The form collects the users first name, second name, and email adddress. 
3. The join us form is valuable to the user as it gives them the ability to sign up to Peace + Mind and claim their free session. 

# Contact Section

1. I created a contact section that contains an email address and phone number, social media links are placed in the footer. 
2. It encourages the user to get in contact and gives them the ability to find and contact Peace + Mind if they need to.

3. I confirm my sections- navigaion, header, about us, sign up, contact text are all readable and easy to understand. 
4. I confirmed that my join us form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works. 

### Bugs

1. When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages I discovered my project was broken, the links to the other files (CSS and videos) did not work. 
2. I discovered this was because I had used absoulte file paths such as this code : (screenshot of code)
3. Removing the starting / fixed the problem. 
4. Another bug I came across was my site wasn't displaying - only the directory listing displayed. 
5. I discovered (with the help of tutor mentoring) that my index.html was nested in my assets folder and so had to be moved to the root directory for it to display properly.

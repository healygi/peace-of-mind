# Peace Of Mind

Welcome to Peace Of Mind a website catered to find your peace of mind. This project hopes to give the user a tranquil, easy flow user experience to find their inner peace. It hopes to also have the ability for the user to sign up to yoga/meditation classes and be able to contact for further information. 

This site is intended for busy working people who want to take some time for themselves for some self-care to improve their focus, reduce stress or anxiety, improve quailty of sleep, make new friends or self-improvement. This site will be useful to the target audience as it offers a range of classes and concepts they can get involved in to achieve their self-care goals. 

Peace Of Mind offers a sign up to have a free session with a "meditation guru" where they will assign classes and tasks to suit the user and their busy schedule.
